# Think Java source code.

<p> This repository is a collection of a small part of the source code from a great book for learning java as a self taught programmer!
The book is 'Think Java' by Allen Downey and Chris Mayfieldand. The code I uploaded here is not complete and may differ a little bit
from the original one that's in the book once I made some modifications to it as I was trying the code and making some testing with diffent 
ideas and ways to implement it. Also it is not complete as I included only the first 8 chapters. </p>

<p>You can check the book out in the book's official web site: https://books.trinket.io/thinkjava2/</p>

<p>You can also obtain a printed version of the book at https://www.oreilly.com/ or www.amazon.com if you prefer.</p>

<p>The source code official repository is the following: https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkJavaCode. <br>Or you can download the complete source in a zipped file (also official): http://tinyurl.com/ThinkJavaCodeZip</p>

<p>Although you can get the entire source code I always suggest that you type it for yourself even if you already know how to program in another 
programming language. If you're an experienced Java programmer that's a different story. But if it's your first contact with Java you'll be better 
if you type the code yourself as you progress through the lessons in the book. And do a lot of code exercises.</p>

<p>Enjoy it and good luck!</p>
