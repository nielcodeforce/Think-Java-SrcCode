# MyOldJavaSnippets

Some of my old Java code snippets. A small collection of code snippets from a great book for learning java as a selftaught programmer!
The book is Think Java and all the code that goes here is available at the book's website for download or you can type it yourself as 
you progress through the lessons in the book's chapters.
