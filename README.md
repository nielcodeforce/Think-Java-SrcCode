# MyOldJavaSnippets

Some of my old Java code snippets. A small collection of code snippets from a great book for learning java as a selftaught programmer!
The book is Think Java and all the code that goes here is available at the book's website for download. But if you really wanna become 
a programmer you'll be better if you type the code yourself as you progress through the lessons in the book's chapters. Always do that 
when you're starting to learn a new programming language. And do a lot of code exercises! There is no better advice than this one to a 
new learner in this field. Good luck!
