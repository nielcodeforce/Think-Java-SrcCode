# MyOldJavaSnippets

This repository is a collection of a small part of the source code from a great book for learning java as a self taught programmer!
The book is 'Think Java' by Allen Downey and Chris Mayfieldand. The code I uploaded here is not complete and may differ a little bit
from the original one that's in the book once I made some modifications to it as I was trying the code and making some testing with diffent 
ideas and ways to implement and it is also not complete as I included only the first 8 chapters. 

Anyhow, most of the code for the first eight chapeters is there. all the code that goes here is available at the book's website for download. But if you really wanna become 
a programmer you'll be better if you type the code yourself as you progress through the lessons in the book's chapters. Always do that 
when you're starting to learn a new programming language. And do a lot of code exercises! There is no better advice than this one to a 
new learner in this field. Good luck!
