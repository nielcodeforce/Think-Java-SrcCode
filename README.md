# Think Java source code.

<p> This repository is a collection of a small portion of the source code from a great book for learning Java as a self taught programmer!
The book is <strong>'Think Java' by Allen Downey and Chris Mayfieldand</strong>. The code uploaded here is not complete and might differ a little bit
from the originals once I made some modifications to them as I was trying the code and making some testing with different ideas and ways to implement it.
It's also not complete - only the first 8 chapters. Below I provide the links to the book's official web site and source code:</p>

<p><strong>[OFFICIAL WEB SITE]</strong></p>
<p>You can check the book out in its official web site: https://books.trinket.io/thinkjava2/</p>

<h1>[PRINTED EDITION BY O'REILLY]</h1>
<p>You can also obtain a printed version of the book at https://www.oreilly.com/ or www.amazon.com if you prefer.</p>

<p><strong>[SOURCE CODE]</strong></p>
<p>The source code official repository is the following: https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkJavaCode. <br>Or you can download the complete source in a zipped file (also official): http://tinyurl.com/ThinkJavaCodeZip</p>

<p>Although you can get the entire source code I always suggest that you type it for yourself even if you already know how to program in another 
language. If you're an experienced Java programmer that's a different story, but if it's your first contact with Java you'll be better if you try 
the code for yourself as you progress through the lessons in the book and do as much code exercises as you can.</p>

<p>By the way, why would you mind these files if you can get the originals? Just as a means of exercise and learning by comparison. You try the code on your own and check
yours with the one I provided so you can compare your solutions and experimentation with someone else's ideas. Of course, all that assuming you already did the same with the code examples in the book.</p>

<p>Enjoy it and good luck!</p>
