# Think Java source code.

<p> This repository is a collection of a small part of the source code from a great book for learning java as a self taught programmer!
The book is 'Think Java' by Allen Downey and Chris Mayfieldand. The code I uploaded here is not complete and may differ a little bit
from the original in the book once I made some modifications to it as I was trying the code and making some testing with diffent 
ideas and ways to implement it. Also it is not complete as I included only the first 8 chapters. Below I provide the links to the book's 
official web site and original source code:</p>

<p>You can check the book out in the book's official web site: https://books.trinket.io/thinkjava2/</p>

<p>You can also obtain a printed version of the book at https://www.oreilly.com/ or www.amazon.com if you prefer.</p>

<p>The source code official repository is the following: https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkJavaCode. <br>Or you can download the complete source in a zipped file (also official): http://tinyurl.com/ThinkJavaCodeZip</p>

<p>Although you can get the entire source code I always suggest that you type it for yourself even if you already know how to program in another 
programming language. If you're an experienced Java programmer that's a different story. But if it's your first contact with Java you'll be better 
if you try the code for yourself as you progress through the lessons in the book and do a lot of code exercises.</p>

<p>By the way, way would you mind these files if you can get the originals? Just as a means of exercise and learning by comparison. You try the code on your own and check
yours with the one I provided. So you can compare your solutions and experimenting with someone else's ideas.</p>

<p>Enjoy it and good luck!</p>
